I have given this topic a lot of thought and spoken to many different people about this topic. What is automation really? Of course many people have different views on the matter. Of course we get the old adage definition of reducing down the toil of mundane and repeatable tasks. I am not disputing that and I am not going to expand that because this definition has beaten as a dead horse. 

I think the more interesting question is what does automation consist of? Because one could argue that automation stops at running scripts / creating functions in your preferred language albiet PowerShell/Bash from  a management bastion host or like Go / Python being packaged up into a web application that can be put into a Platform as a Service in the cloud. But for me there is a lot more to it than that. 

There is no doubt that these all contribute automation. However the process to write , test , implement the automation is where I think the magic starts to happen. As an ex colleague of mine said, when I demonstrated the concept this is what you call by end to end automation.

In my mind, automation consists of three main parts.

* Plumbing
* Frameworks
* Flow

# Plumbing
These are programming languages. PowerShell, Bash, Go, Python.  While they can exist on their own, and they could overlap the other two  I have found that these are best served  
# Frameworks

# Flow
